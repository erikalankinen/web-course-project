# Web Course Project

## Description
This project was completed as part of a web development course. It is a full-stack web application that demonstrates both frontend and backend skills. The frontend is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while the backend uses TypeScript to handle server-side logic.

The project allowed me to practice building interactive web interfaces, connecting frontend to backend services, and managing data flow between client and server.
